### Try to refrain from using the main branch for your sites in the meantime. Use the `post-type-revamp` branch with some modifications or just wait a little longer for the v1.1.0 release as there are major DB changes.

## Self Executing, Processing, and Handling of Information from Real-world Applications

An Angular 12 front end with a complete Flask RESTful API complete with server-side rendering, password authentication, two-factor time-based one time passwords, JWT tokens, database CRUD, file uploading and retrieving, cookies, async emailing on-demand and async cron-style tasks, socket.io, ReCAPTCHA V3 support, and in-browser page and main menu creation and editing, as well as a full ecommerce template with Stripe Payment Intent API and webhook integration, Paypal Smart Buttons, and Coinbase Commerce API and webhook integration complete with US zip tax handling and custom shipping zones

## How to get the project running

See [sephira.org](https://sephira.org/) (I have plans to redo it a little once the new post type system is done)

See the Angular and Flask folders for clear instructions on how to get each runnning.

Please feel free to add and improve this project.
