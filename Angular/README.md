# Angular Starter

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.1.

## Installation

Run `npm install` in this directory to install all required packages.

## Development server

Run `npm run dev:ssr` for an express server that supports server-side rendering. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `build:ssr:production` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Upload the entirety of the `dist/` folder to the production server as the angular universal server is looking for it.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
