# Angular Starter

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.1.

## Installation

Run `npm install` in this directory to install all required packages.

## Development server

Run `npm run dev:ssr` for an express server that supports server-side rendering. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
